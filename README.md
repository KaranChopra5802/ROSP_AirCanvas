    <h1>OpenCV Gesture Detection Project</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This README file provides information about a project that utilizes OpenCV for gesture detection. This project aims to recognize and interpret hand gestures in real-time video streams or images. By leveraging the power of OpenCV, the project enables developers to create applications for various domains, such as sign language translation, human-computer interaction, and more.
    
To use the gesture detection system in this project, you can interact with it through intuitive hand gestures. The system has been designed to make the selection between erasing and drawing a seamless process. For selecting between erasing and drawing, simply raise two fingers on your hand. This gesture will prompt the system to switch between the two modes, making it easy to transition between drawing and erasing actions. To perform actual drawing or erasing, raise just one finger, and the system will recognize this as your intent to either draw or erase, allowing you to create and modify content effortlessly. This intuitive and responsive gesture-based interface enhances user experience and simplifies the creative process.</p>
